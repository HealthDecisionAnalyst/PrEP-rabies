## Required packages
ggplot2/ ggthemes/ dplyr/ plotly

## Using this model
step1) clone this repository to your computer and then run three functions in folder Function: "Function_Tornado_ICER.R", "Function_contour_ICER.R", and "Function_sensitivity_analysis.R" files

step2) run scripts in folder calculate_ICER to obtaion the outputs
step3) run scripts in fokder Plot to obtain the plots: 
       1) Tornado plot for Indremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)
       2) Individual plot of the impact of varying each key parameter in a one-way sensitivity analysis
       3) Contour plot of the ICER across a range of variables
       

## Inputs & Outputs 
Table 1, present input paramaters and its sources
All output data can be found as results in files in folder calculate_ICER


## Figures
Main figures for this work including: 
1) Tornado plot for Indremental Cost-Effectiveness Ratio (ICER)
2) Individual plot of the impact of varying each key parameter in a one-way sensitivity analysis
3) Contour plot of the ICER across a range of variables
